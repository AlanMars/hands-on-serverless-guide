# Hands-on Guide For Building Serverless Applications

This is a hands-on guide for building Serverless applications. This guide is divided into various sections. The first section is about building serverless applications with the [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) framework and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). This guide is a work in progress so I will keep adding content as I continue to learn and understand the Serverless ecosystem.

I plan to cover different Serverless providers and tools in the Serverless ecosystem. Follow this repository to learn and master the Serverless ecosystem.

## Sections
